Q1: Name: Amro Abu-atieh

Q2: Any other notes for the grader:
Thank you very much for reviewing my code!

Q3: Runtime for contains and getSequence methods:
The runtime that I am saying I have for both the contains and getSequence methods is O(log(n)). n in this case is the number of charachetrs in the code book. I did this by making the Binary tree in Huffman Code Book effiecient allowing for a bettrr big O runtime.

Q4: What is the runtime of the HuffmanCodeTree.decode method?
The runtime for the decode method in HuffmanCodeTree is O(b), where b is the number of bits in the BinarySequence. This is because the method goes through each bit in the sequence one by one, and for each bit, it looks through the tree in constant time, thus giving O(b).
